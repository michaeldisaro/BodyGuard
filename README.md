# BodyGuard
A .NETCore user management server to provide registration, login and other GDPR compliant features.

Work in progress at very early stage.

There are some cryptographic and payload issues to resolve, and some configuration to move somewhere else, before building the user related services.

DO NOT USE AT THIS MOMENT! I WILL RELEASE IT AS SOON AS IT CAN BE AN ALPHA VERSION.
